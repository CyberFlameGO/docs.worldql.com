# Scripts

Scripts allow you to program dynamic behavior inside WorldQL. This environment is familiar to anyone who has used an ECS before. Scripts can be used to allow Entities to dynamically interact with each other or to run scheduled tasks on your World.

:::caution Coming soon!

Scripts are not yet implemented in WorldQL. They will be released alongside Entities early next year.
