# Entities

Entities represent temporary and dynamic objects in a World. They can be used for:
- NPCs
- Enemies and ambient creatures
- Players (sometimes)
  - If you're using WorldQL to compliment an existing game server, it's better to simply use a LocalMessage to pass information about player state.

:::caution Coming soon!

Entities are not yet implemented in WorldQL. They will be released alongside our scripting environment early next year.
